SharpUltimateTools is a large repository of scripts for use in any C# program. It contains the following:
- OSInfo - Contains many classes that return information about the current Windows installation. This includes Architecture, Edition, Name, Product Key, Service Pack, User Info and Version.
- HWInfo - Contains many classes that return information about the current computer hardware. This includes BIOS, Network, OEM, Processor, RAM and Storage.
- SecurityTools - Contains methods surrounding hashing and encryption. Includes methods using MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512. Also includes encryption/decryption with RSA.
- CommandInfo - Allows you to run any console command and will return the result to a string to use within your program. You can also run the command elevated and it will open in a new cmd window and show the results. Note: If elevated, result cannot be returned as a string.
- DBTools - Contains methods to communicate with a database. It currently supports only SQLite and does not require you to import any of the SQLite libraries.
- ProgramInfo - Returns info about the current assembly. This includes Title, Version, Description, Product Name, Copyright, Company, Startup Path and ExecutablePath. Also contains a method to save embedded resouces to disk. 
- WebTools - Contains utilities for HTML and JSON.
- And Much More!
